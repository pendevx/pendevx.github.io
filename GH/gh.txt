Non-immersive VR:
    The player directly interacts with a virtual environment, but the virtual environment does not directly interact with the player 
        i.e. the player controls the game via input device, but the game's output device does not impact the player 
    Interact with virual environment without feeling of being immersed inside the virtual environment
    Player keeps control of the physical surroundings, such as see, feel, smell sense etc 


Semi-immersive VR: 
    Between non-immersive and fully-immersive 
    Uses only visual effects to achieve semi-immersive vr
        NO physical feelings provided by the VR 
    e.g. virtual tours, only require a screen or VR glasses/headset to let the person be involved but is only visual not physical 

Fully-immersive VR: realistic simulation 
    Realistic virtual experience, including visual AND physical feel 
    Feels as in the virtual experience is actually happening 
    Equipment can involve VR glasses/headset, AND: VR gloves, body detector, movement sensor to help provide realistic experience 



IMMERSIVE VS NON IMMERSIVE:
    IMMERSIVE: Aim to isolate the user from the physical world, and become involved inside the virual world as much as possible 
        Equipment used: 
    NON IMMERSIVE: Does not aim to isolate the user from the physical world, the user may still interact with both easily


Usages of VR:
    Automotive - allows engineers and designers to work in a virtual environment to create vehicles and prototypes which is cheaper and doesn't require using real items, saving money
    Healthcare - allows doctors and surgeons to try and check what works without having to harm a real person, allows for gaining experience and preparation before performing actual surgery
        Also can be used to help patients with mental health issues, use VR therapy 
    Retail - newer, more realistic version of online shopping 
    Tourism - see places for cheaper using just VR technology
    Architecture - easy to see structure and easy to modify a building, good for the architect and any other viewers 
    Job recruitment - have interview much more easily from just home without needing to go out
    Entertainment - watch videos and stuff in more realistic view
    Education - allow students to learn in a better more suitable environment per subject/topic, just go to that place and help students to learn better 
    Meetings - now everybody can go to meeting without excuse, and is much more suitable for people who need to go overseas or travel long distance to a meeting 
    Wellbeing - let user find and choose their own more comfortable place or virtual space, can relieve stress etc 
    Social - allow people to be together without actually being together 


Advantages of VR:
    Saves time from many jobs 
    Saves the user having to move around to the physical location, which is waste of body energy
    Saves money for many industrial operations
