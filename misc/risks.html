					There are 2 major risks for the sellers when it comes to VR technology. First off is the heavy competition within
					the industry. Many companies have tagged along on this trend and are working as fast and as hard as possible to make
					the best, most entertaining VR technology out there to gain the most customers. This is a risk because if a company were
					to fall too far behind in the current stages, or not work fast enough, the company will lose money, may have to leave the VR
					industry or, at worst, the company will fail.<br><br>
					The second risk is the production of VR hardware and software. It is difficult to have peak software performance to ensure the
					user has the best experience. It can be difficult to hire the correct people with the best skills to fit these requirements. These
					are necessities when going up against other companies and making the best VR equipment out there.

				</ul><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Consumer Risks<p></h2>
					There are multiple consumer risks involved with VR technology. There are many physical problems that could occur to the user.
					Prolonged and incorrect use of screens is known to cause eyesight problems and that has been known for many years. With VR 
					technology all involving screens and especially very close to the eyes, this could cause some significant damage if the user uses
					this technology incorrectly. Users would also be prone to damages of the body through the use of headsets as they may not be aware
					of their immediate surroundings, or even forgetting about their surrounds due to being so immersed. They may bump into any objects
					or people around them, or trip over anything on the floor. It is important for the user to ensure all safety measures are in place.<br><br>
					There are also the mental issues the user may encounter through using too much VR technology. With the user being immersed into their
					fantasy world, people may start to use this as an escape from the real world and refuse to come back out. It is easy for some people
					to forget the difference between what is real and what is not. This could cause some serious social isolation for many users.<br><br>
					With all technology, there is also the potential to get hacked and users’ data may be stolen. It is up to both the user and the manufacturer
					to ensure all measures are in place to make sure this doesn’t happen to the user.
