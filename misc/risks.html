					- The VR industry nowadays has heavy competition, so if a company is to invest too much into a piece of VR equipment, it is a large risk for the seller.<br>
					- VR hardware and software, specifically software performance and user experience, are both difficult to design and create, so it would 
					therefore be more difficult for a company or manufacturer to hire employees which fir their requirements.

				</ul><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Consumer Risks<p></h2>
					- VR equipment could cause physical damage to the user, such as using VR headsets or large screens being to close to the user's eyes, this could 
					definitely damage the user's eyes and eyesight. <br>
					- If the user becomes too immersed in the virtual world, it is easy to forget about the real world around them. If an emergency or the like happens 
					whilst the user is still playing their games, it is a very large risk for the user. <br>
					And, as always, any piece of electronic equipment are all prone to being hacked.
