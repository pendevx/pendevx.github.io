  <h1>Development of VR Technology in Video Games</h1>
  </div>
  

</ul><h1 style="text-align: center;"><p>What is VR?<p></h1>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px">VR is currently split into 3 different categories. Non-immersive VR, semi-immersive VR and Fully immersive VR. </p>

<div class="bodytext1">
  <div class="column">
    <p>
        </ul><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Non-Immersive VR<p></h2>
        <img src="../images/personplayinggames.png" style="border:2px solid rgb(135, 0, 0); float:left;" width="360" height="200" alt="Non-Immersive Vr">
        <p style="font-size: 17px; margin-top: 250px;">First you have your classic non immersive VR experience which is just your typical gaming set up of your keyboard or controller and such 
        with your monitor or TV in front of you. Your standard gaming experience.</p>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="bodytext1">
  <div class="column">
    <p>
    </ul><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Semi-Immersive VR<p></h2>
      <img src="../images/vrheadset.png" style="border:2px solid rgb(135, 0, 0); margin-left: 40px; " width="300" height="200" alt="Non-Immersive Vr">
      <p style="font-size: 17px">Then we have semi immersive VR which is the current stage of VR which uses either large monitors to surround the player or a headset that sits on the players head. 
        This lets the player get immersed into their gaming environment visually, but not physically. </p>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="bodytext1">
  <div class="column">
    <p>
        </ul><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Fully-Immersive VR<p></h2>
          <img src="../images/fullyimmersive.png" style="border:2px solid rgb(135, 0, 0); margin-left: 40px;" width="300" height="200" alt="Non-Immersive Vr">
          <p style="font-size: 17px">Finally we have fully immersive VR which is the future of VR gaming and is currently being worked on as we speak. At this stage
            they are continuing the use of headsets but are trying to achieve real virtual 3D views in order to bring the virtual items right in front of you to be able to interact with. 
            This also includes the use of body controls to bring yourself into your gaming environment. The idea is for you to not be able to tell real life from virtual life. </p>
