					<b><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Economically<p></h2></b>
					Having the option of using virtual reality technology can be considered an economically responsible choice for many businesses. 
					They are able to save money for industrial operations such as designing and architecture without needing to use real
					materials to create prototypes. They can instead create a virtual version for a much cheaper price which will save money 
					and resources. While the one off cost of a virtual reality set can be very expensive, it will eventually pay itself off through no longer
					having to make these prototypes. There are also many software’s out there that give these companies the ability to do this 
					and with the technology growing everyday, it will make it easier for these companies to begin doing this.

					<b><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Time-Wise<p></h2></b>
					VR technology allows players the choice to meet up with somebody without having to physically meet up with them. This would cut
					out the time and cost of travelling. For example, you are able to play with your friends within the virtual reality world rather than in person.
					With the advancement of VR, soon it will be able to feel as if your friend is physically there. This is already becoming apparent
					due to the game “VRChat” which is widely popular for people who want to hang out but not meet up in person.<br><br>
					This type of technology can also be used for businesses. To save the time of workers and make things more efficient, such as meetings
					or conferences, you can hold these over the use of VR. This will avoid any inconveniences due to workers living far away and will help
					save money and stamina for all the workers involved.

					<b><h2><p style="text-align: center;">People-Wise<p></h2></b>
					For the users, virtual reality technology can conserve the users stamina and allow the player to visit any location they please and achieve whatever
					they want whilst requiring only a small amount of movement. However, virtual reality can also help people achieve a healthier lifestyle by letting
					users get physical without leaving their house. There are games specifically designed to play sports or help players work out through
					the comfort of their own home and by doing something they love which is play video games. This will help improve their physical quality
					of life whereas your standard gaming experience can’t do that.
