					For players, this could mean meeting up with somebody is something which could happen directly, without the need to spend time to travel distances.
					For example, meeting up with a friend to play a game together (but inside the VR world).<br>
					Inside other industries, this could mean saving time for workers, if for example needing to attend a conference from a long distance away,
					this could be completed instead much more easily through VR equipment, which would also save money and stamina for all attendees.

					Conserves stamina for the user as VR equipment allows the user to go to any location and do whatever they want whilst requiring little movement.
