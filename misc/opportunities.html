					At the current moment, virtual reality is growing at an insanely rapid pace. This makes virtual reality an excellent field for development and company growth.
					There are many routes to take with virtual reality which gives many opportunities to create different types of games with the technology. This would
					open the door for many new curious gamers to get involved with this new technology while also creating a new way for current gamers to
					experience their favourite hobby. Due to this, it would create a boom in the market, if done so correctly. Gupta, 2019, states that in a
					survey taken in 2015 the global revenue for virtual reality gaming was $4.3 billion. With the rate at which virtual reality technology is developing, they could see
					a massive increase in revenues throughout the years.<br><br>
					Covid has also played a part in the rising market of virtual reality headsets with 70% of surveyed users stating they purchased their headsets within the
					last 12 months. 90% of those users also stated their headsets were used for gaming. This was so players could play with friends and family throughout the pandemic.

					</ul><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Player<p></h2>
					virtual reality technology creates a whole new field for current gamers to explore from their old one. It also grabs the attention of potential new gamers
					to come and try out gaming. The idea of the headsets is to create a new and enriching game environment for the players to explore. For many years,
					gamers have had to play with the same experience but now for the first time they are able to immerse themselves visually and soon to be physically
					into their fantasy worlds. <br><br>
					With the unexpected global pandemic, virtual reality technology also gave players the opportunity to still connect with family and friends. As mentioned within
					the market section, many users purchased their headset within the pandemic to keep connected to loved ones. This proves how virtual reality technology has served
					as an important escape for those whose social interactions had become limited or for those who are physically confined by the covid lockdowns.

					</ul><h2><p style="text-align: center;">Jobs<p></h2>
					With virtual reality being such new type of technology, a bunch of new skills are required. Due to this, many new jobs will be created which involved different
					types of skills. Within the gaming industry, more than just your typical game designers, artists, programmers will be needed. Jobs will open up which
					will involved a more hardware design approach rather than focusing on the actual game. With this industry on the rise, there will also be a higher
					demand for your standard game designers, artists and programmers. Both sectors will be benefited due to virtual reality technology.
