Non-immersive VR:
    The player directly interacts with a virtual environment, but the virtual environment does not directly interact with the player 
        i.e. the player controls the game via input device, but the game's output device does not impact the player 
    Interact with virual environment without feeling of being immersed inside the virtual environment
    Player keeps control of the physical surroundings, such as see, feel, smell sense etc 


Semi-immersive VR: 
    Between non-immersive and fully-immersive 
    Uses only visual effects to achieve semi-immersive vr
        NO physical feelings provided by the VR 
    e.g. virtual tours, only require a screen or VR glasses/headset to let the person be involved but is only visual not physical 

Fully-immersive VR: realistic simulation 
    Realistic virtual experience, including visual AND physical feel 
    Feels as in the virtual experience is actually happening 
    Equipment can involve VR glasses/headset, AND: VR gloves, body detector, movement sensor to help provide realistic experience 



IMMERSIVE VS NON IMMERSIVE:
    IMMERSIVE: Aim to isolate the user from the physical world, and become involved inside the virual world as much as possible 
        Equipment used: 
    NON IMMERSIVE: Does not aim to isolate the user from the physical world, the user may still interact with both easily
